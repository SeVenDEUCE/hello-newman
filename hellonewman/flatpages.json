He currently resides in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a young artist, Newman, was meticulous. Much of his time was spent studying, drawing, and painting wildlife.  He possessed an entrepreneurial spirit from an early age. He began his career by contracting work such as graphite portraits, and architectural renderings. After a short college career he spent several years in the  advertising, and creative industry, until finding solace in a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/busyashell/6145487170/in/photostream/\">home studio</a> in late 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still today, Newman specializes in portrait, uncanny semi-realistic caricature, and wildlife illustrations; as well as design, and development for the intertubes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greg has done work for a wide variety of clients including the likes of National Geographic, Discovery Channel, and Broadway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are in need of detail oriented, quality work <a href=\"/contact/\">contact Greg</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Interviews and Exhibits</h3>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.macworldiworld.com/digital-art-gallery/\" target=\"_blank\">Macworld/iWorld Digital Art Exhibit 2012</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://theappleartist.com/496/the-apple-artist-podcast-004-time-tracking-invoicing-to-do-apps\" target=\"_blank\">The Apple Artist: Podcast #4</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://processmade.com/greg-newman-his-man-cave-and-paintings\">ProcessMade</a>",
